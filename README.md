# COVID-19-Data-Mining

<!-- Milestone 2 -->
<!-- ### Notes:
### -execute src/"Milestone 2"/main_ms2.py to generate a .pkl model, a plot, and a report for each classification algorithm
### -main_ms2.py may take roughly an hour to finish -->

<!-- Milestone 1
### Notes: ###
### -main.py may take roughly 10 minutes to run for all the cleaning, imputing, and joining tasks on datasets
### -eda.ipynb may take roughly 2 minutes to run all the cells since one the first cells is transforming a dataframe that is later used in some of the plots
### -please ensure all libraries in the eda.ipynb file are installed so that every plot will appear -->
