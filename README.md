<!-- Milestone 1
### Notes: ###
### -main.py may take roughly 10 minutes to run for all the cleaning, imputing, and joining tasks on datasets
### -eda.ipynb may take roughly 2 minutes to run all the cells since one the first cells is transforming a dataframe that is later used in some of the plots
### -please ensure all libraries in the eda.ipynb file are installed so that every plot will appear -->
